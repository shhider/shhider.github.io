I'm honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest university in the world. Truth be told, I never graduated from college. And this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories. That's it. No big deal, just three stories.

The first story is about connecting the dots.

I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for anthor 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?

It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everythoing was all set for me to be apdopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I poped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on the waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking:"We have a unexcept baby boy. Do you want him?"They said:"Of course." My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduate from hight school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promise that I would someday go to college.

And 17 years later, I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.
