summary: Text of Steve Jobs' Commencement address (2005)

I'm honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest university in the world. Truth be told, I never graduated from college. And this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories. That's it. No big deal, just three stories.

The first story is about connecting the dots.

I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for anthor 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?

It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everythoing was all set for me to be apdopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I poped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on the waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking:"We have a unexcept baby boy. Do you want him?"They said:"Of course." My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduate from hight school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promise that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.

And 17 years later, I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After 6 months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.

It wasn't all romatic. I didn't have dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5 cents deposits to buy food with. and I would walk the 7 milesacross town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishana temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:

Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the ampus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif ans sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combination, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful,historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, nad I found it fascinating.

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, When we were designing the first Macintosh compuetr, it all came back to me . And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I has never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likey that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computer might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in the college. But it was very, every clear looking backward 10 years later.

Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwoar. So you hace to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have ti truest in something--your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

My second story is about love and loss.

I was lucky - I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. We had just released our finest creation - the Macintosh - a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a compony you started? Well, as Apple grew me hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future begen to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the foucs of me entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.
